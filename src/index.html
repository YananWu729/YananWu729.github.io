            <h3>Chinese painting workshop: plum blossom</h3>
            <p>
              It was the beginning of spring, and Year 4 students were learning
              colour vocabulary in Mandarin lessons. So I thought it would be
              great for the culture workshop's topic to focus on Chinese
              painting, where students could not only gain real-life experience
              in Chinese painting but also reinforce their memory of colour
              vocabulary.

            <p>
              This is Year 6 student Nitya's calligraphy work. During Chinese
              New Year celebrations, students learned about traditional customs
              and became intrigued by the character “福” (fú, meaning “luck”). I
              demonstrated how to write it, and afterward, students practiced
              creating their own versions of the character.

            <p>
              After a school trip to the British Museum, students' interests in
              blue-and-white porcelain were piqued. I held a workshop to
              introduce it in detail, and students designed their own
              blue-and-white porcelain patterns on paper plates. Some even tried
              writing the Chinese characters for “blue and white porcelain”
              (青花瓷).

            <h3>Chinese workshop: Beijing opera facial makeup</h3>
            <p>
              My students have a very deep appreciation for the story "Journey
              to the West". Their favourite figure has always been the Monkey
              King. After the session of Beijing Opera, I thought it would be so
              thrilling for my students that they will make a Beijing opera
              facial makeup for the Monkey King. My thought turned out to be
              true. They had a lot of fun.

            <h3>Chinese traditional clothes workshop: Qipao</h3>
            <p>
              A group of my students watched a Chinese costume drama and enjoyed
              it. They asked why I never wore stylish clothes like the
              actresses. This inspired me to introduce Chinese traditional
              clothes to my students. When they were introduced to Qipao, a very
              well-known Chinese traditional clothing, they couldn't wait to
              design their versions of Qipao, hoping that they could make it
              real one day. I had fear that boys would't enjoy this workshop as
              much as girls did, but I was wrong, they told me that they wanted
              to make one for their moms. I found it so sweet and touching.
