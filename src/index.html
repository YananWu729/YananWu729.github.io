            I am a qualified Chinese and English teacher, a frontend developer,
            who also has great passion for photography, caring about our society
            and planet. <br />I would like to make some positive impacts.

            It was the beginning of spring, and Year 4 students were learning
            colour vocabulary in Mandarin lessons. So I thought it would be
            great for the culture workshop's topic to focus on Chinese painting,
            where students could not only gain real-life experience in Chinese
            painting but also reinforce their memory of colour vocabulary.

        <p>
          This is Year 6 student Nitya's calligraphy work. During Chinese New
          Year celebrations, students learned about traditional customs and
          became intrigued by the character “福” (fú, meaning “luck”). I
          demonstrated how to write it, and afterward, students practiced
          creating their own versions of the character.

        <p>
          After a school trip to the British Museum, students' interests in
          blue-and-white porcelain were piqued. I held a workshop to introduce
          it in detail, and students designed their own blue-and-white
          porcelain patterns on paper plates. Some even tried writing the
          Chinese characters for “blue and white porcelain” (青花瓷).

        <div class="text">
          <p>
            My students have a very deep appreciation for the story "Journey to
            the West". Their favourite figure has always been the Monkey King.
            After the session of Beijing Opera, I thought it would be so
            thrilling for my students that they will make a Beijing opera facial
            makeup for the Monkey King. My thought turned out to be true. They
            had a lot of fun.

        <div class="text">
          <p>
            A group of my students watched a Chinese costume drama and enjoyed
            it. They asked why I never wore stylish clothes like the actresses.
            This inspired me to introduce Chinese traditional clothes to my
            students. When they were introduced to Qipao, a very well-known
            Chinese traditional clothing, they couldn't wait to design their
            versions of Qipao, hoping that they could make it real one day. I
            had fear that boys would't enjoy this workshop as much as girls did,
            but I was wrong, they told me that they wanted to make one for their
            moms. I found it so sweet and touching.
