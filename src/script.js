And once again, I have seen another stunning pinky sunset, which I will never get tired of, while standing on on the millennium bridge. It made me very pleased.",

To be honest, I have mixed feeling about this. For one thing, there are signs around, saying we should not feed the wild life, but still, people would ignore them. For another, if everyone respects the signs, I will not be able to see this cute moment between human beings and wild animals.",
